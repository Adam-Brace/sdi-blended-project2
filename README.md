# Pok√©Search Machine

Problem Statement - I need an app that lets me search pokemon by name or with attribute filters if I do not know the specific pokemon. After I have found the pokemon I am searching for, I want to see its specifc statistics like type, moveset etc. I also want to be able to add the pokemon to a couple lists. One list will be "My Collection" to simulate the current pokemon I have captured for the game they are playing. And another list, call it wishlist, for pokemon they are still looking for.

User Statement -
As a User, I want to be able to search for a Pokemon and see its moves, types, weaknesses, and base stats so I can be a more effective fighter.
